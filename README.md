# Guidelines
### Issues guidelines
- Start have regular team meet, discuss daily goles and share work along with teams.
- Don't work on anything unless you are assigned, if you make a pull request without being assigned to that issue, it will be closed without being merged
- Don't work on more than one issue at a time, this is so that you don't make a huge pull request and others can have opportunities to work on another issue while you work on something else

### Pull Guideline
- Don't work on the main branch, create your own branch by following the instructions here
    ```git
    git checkout -b [branchname]
    ```
    * Update your branch.
